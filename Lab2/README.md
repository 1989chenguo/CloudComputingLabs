# 1. Overview

Implement an HTTP server based on HTTP/1.1 from scratch by your own, using network programming knowledges learned from our class. 

Also, try to use high concurrency programming skills learned from the class to guarantee the web server's performance.

**Our Goals:**

* Practice basic network programming skills, such as using socket API, parsing packets;
* Get familiar with robust and high-performance concurrent programming.

# 2. Backround

**Please check [background.md](./background.md) first to learn some basics about `HTTP`, `HTTP messages` , `HTTP proxy`, `JSON` & `curl`.**

# 3. Your Lab Task

## Implement your own HTTP Server

In this Lab, we won't provide any basic code. You should implement a HTTP server based on HTTP/1.1, from scratch which satisfies the following requirements:

**HTTP Server Outline**

From a network standpoint, your HTTP server should implement the following:

1. Create a listening socket and bind it to a port;
1. Wait a client to connect to the port;
1. Accept the client and obtain a new connection socket;
1. Read in and parse the HTTP request;
1. Start delivering services (*some are optional*): 
   * Handle HTTP GET/POST requests and return responses. 
   * Proxy the request to another HTTP server.

The server will be in either non-proxy mode or proxy mode (we have introduced the proxy in background section `2.3`). It does not do both things at the same time.

In order to better test and score, we have made **some functional requirements** for your submitted works.

**ATTENTION**: Lab 2 is a pre-lab of Lab 4. If you plan to complete Lab 4, please complete **the advanced version** of Lab 2. 

### 3.1 Handle HTTP request & send HTTP response

In this Lab, **you just need to implement the GET method and the POST method in your HTTP server**. 

For any other methods, your server should send a response with 501 status code (see `2.2`).
That is to say, if your HTTP server receive a HTTP request but the request method is neither GET nor POST, the HTTP server just need to return a 501 Not Implemented error message (a response message with Response line having status code to be 501, see `2.2`).

See examples in section [3.7](#37-access-your-http-server).

#### 3.1.1 Handle HTTP GET request

The HTTP server should be able to handle HTTP GET requests for specific resources, e.g., web service data & static files.

For a GET request, the server needs to check whether the path of request corresponds to a web service or a existed static file.

What you need to do:

**basic version**:

* A search service: use a specific url to get some data from the server that does not come from a file stored on the file system.
  * The url don't have query string, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/api/check`;
  * Send response with plain text content.

* Static files access: use a specific url to access a text file stored on the file system.
  * Clients only request `*.html`;
  * Clients may request a file in subdirectories, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/test/index.html`;
  * Send response with the full content of html file.

* If the path is invalid or the static file does not exist
  * Send response with the full content of `404 Not Found` page.

**advanced version**:

* A search service: use a specific url to get some data from the server that does not come from a file stored on the file system.
  * The url may have query string, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/search?id=1&name=foo`;
  * The query string contains some key-value pairs. Keys are `id` & `name`;
  * If the query string is valid, send response with json type content.
  * Or if invalid, send response with json type content, including error messages;

* Static files access: use a specific url to access a text file stored on the file system.
  * Clients may request `*.html`, `*.js`, `*.css`, `*.json` and other plain text files;
  * Clients may request a file in subdirectories, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/test/index.html`;
  * Send Response with the correct `Content-Type` & the full content of the file.

* If the path is invalid or the static file does not exist
  * Send response with the full content of `404 Not Found` page.

*You don't need to implement to transmit base64 encoded binary files, such as image files like `*.png`.* 

#### 3.1.2 Handle HTTP POST request

The HTTP server should be able to handle HTTP POST requests.

For a POST request, the server needs to check whether the path of request corresponds to a web service.

> For special characters, like `%`, you may need google about **percent encoding**.

What you need to do:

**basic version**:

* A upload service: use a specific url to upload some data to the server
  * The content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`;
  * The payload contains key-value pairs, keys are `id` & `name`;
  * If the payload is valid, send response with `200 OK`, `Content-Type: text/plain` & data;
  * Or if the payload invalid, send response with send response with `404 Not Found`, `Content-Type: text/plain` & error messages;

* If the path is invalid
  * Send response with the full content of `404 Not Found` page.

**advanced version**:

* A upload service: use a specific url to upload some data from the server that does not come from a file stored on the file system.
  * The content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `application/json`;
  * The payload contains key-value pairs, keys are `id` & `name`;
  * If the payload is valid, send response with `200 OK`, `Content-Type: application/json` & data;
  * Or if the payload invalid, send response with send response with `404 Not Found`, `Content-Type: application/json` & error messages;

* If the path is invalid
  * Send response with the full content of `404 Not Found` page.

If you are not familiered with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, check [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data).

#### 3.1.3 Other request

Just return 501 Not Implemented page for other request method (e.g. DELETE, PUT, etc.).

### 3.2 Implement a proxy server (optional for advanced version)

Enable your server to proxy HTTP requests to another HTTP server and forward the responses to the clients.

1. You should use the value of the `--proxy` command line argument, which contains the address and port number of the upstream HTTP server.
   
2. Your proxy server should wait for new data on both sockets (the HTTP client file descriptor, and the upstream HTTP server file descriptor). When data arrives, you should immediately read it to a buffer and then write it to the other socket. You are essentially maintaining 2-way communication between the HTTP client and the upstream HTTP server. Note that your proxy must support multiple requests/responses.

3. If either of the sockets closes, communication cannot continue, so you should close the other socket and exit the child process.

Hints: 1) This is more tricky than writing to a file or reading from stdin, since you do not know which side of the 2-way stream will write data first, or whether they will write more data after receiving a response. 2) You should again use threads for this task. For example, consider using two threads to facilitate the two-way communication, one from A to B and the other from B to A.

> Most websites now use HTTPS and will check your HTTP header lines, your proxy server may not be suitable for any web server.
> 
> It is not our task to implement protocols other than HTTP. 
> 
> They often involve encryption algorithms and are difficult to implement directly using socket api. 
> 
> However, if you are interested in protocols such as HTTPS, you can try to use other libraries, e.g. openssl. 

### 3.3 Use multi-thread to increase concurrency

Your HTTP server should use multiple threads to handle as many concurrent clients' requests as possible. You have at least the following three options to architect your multi-thread server:

- **On-demand threads**.  You can can create a new thread whenever a new client comes in, and use that thread to handle all that clients' task, including parsing the HTTP request, fetching page files, and sending response. The thread can be destroyed after that client finishes, e.g, detect through TCP `recv()`.  However,it may not be easy to detect client finish in the HTTP layer.

- **A pool of always-on threads**. You can use a fixed-sized thread pool in your HTTP server program for handling multiple client requests concurrently. If there are no tasks, those threads are in a waiting state. If a new client comes in, assign a thread to handle the client's request and send response to it. If the assigned thread is busy, you can use a work queue to buffer the request, and let the thread process it later.  

- **Combined**. Combine above two styles together. For example, you can use thread pool to receive request and send response, and use on-demand threads to fetch large page files.  

Feel free to choose any one from the above three, or use other multi-thread architecture that you think is cool.

### 3.4 Support HTTP pipelining

In the basic version, you have **only one request per TCP connection going on at the same time**. The client waits for response, and when it gets response, perhaps reuses the TCP connection for a new request (or use a new TCP connection). This is also what normal HTTP server supports.

In the advanced version, **multiple http requests can be fired concurrently on one TCP connection**. This is also called HTTP pipelining which is supported by many real browsers and servers (such as Chrome). Note that HTTP requests that come from the same TCP connection should be responded in the same order. So take care the order problem when using complex multi-thread styles. 

### 3.5 Specify arguments

Your program should enable long options to accept arguments and specify those arguments during start.

They are:

| arguments | descriptions |
| --- | --- |
| -i, --ip \<IP\> | Specify the server IP address. |
| -p, --port \<PORT\> | Selects which port the HTTP server listens on for incoming connections. |
| --proxy \<PROXY\> | Selects an "upstream" HTTP server to proxy. |
| -t, --threads \<THREADS\> | Number of threads if you use multi-thread. |

The `--proxy` can have a schema before `://` and a port number after a colon (e.g. `http://www.example.com:80`). If a port number is not specified, port 80 is the default for HTTP.

If you have no idea about *long options*, you can read [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html#Argument-Syntax). And you may need to use some functions like `getopt_long()`, `getopt_long_only()`, `getopt()` and so on. Check those function's usage with the `man` command.

### 3.6 Run your HTTP Server

**For advanced version**:

Your program should be able to start at terminal. If your program is called *http-server*, just typing:

in the non-proxy mode: 

`./http-server --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --threads 8` 

It means that your HTTP server's IP address is 127.0.0.1 and service port is 8888. The --number-thread indicates that there are 8 threads in the thread pool for handling multiple client request concurrently.

in the proxy mode:

`./http-server --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --threads 8 --proxy http://www.example.com:80`

It means that this is an HTTP proxy server. This proxy's IP address is 127.0.0.1 and service port is 8888. And the proxy has a thread pool with 8 threads. The --proxy indicates that the "upstream" HTTP server is `http://www.example.com:80`. So, if you send a request message to this proxy (i.e. `127.0.0.1:8888`), it will forward this request message to the "upstream" HTTP server (i.e. `http://www.example.com:80`) and forward the response message to the client.

> If you want to access this server from other host, maybe you should open the firewall corresponding to the port and bind the ip to 0.0.0.0.

When you run the command above, your HTTP server should run correctly.

### 3.7 Access Your HTTP Server

We assume that the ip the server bound is `127.0.0.1` and the port is `8080`. If the proxy feature is used, the remote server is `www.example.com`.

For more efficient testing and scoring, we need you to implement some of the interfaces described below, and make sure that the content of the response is consistent with our expectations.

**That's why we provide some standard static files. You can check those files in `./static/` & `./data/`.**

Please make sure your server supports accessing them, and **do not modify their content or relative paths**.

#### 3.7.1 Using GET method

**1) access static files**

For **basic** version:

| path | files in local fs | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /, /index.html | /`{static dir}`/index.html | 200 | text/html |
| /404.html | /`{static dir}`/404.html | 404 | text/html |
| /501.html | /`{static dir}`/501.html | 501 | text/html |
| any other error paths | /`{static dir}`/404.html | 404 |text/html |

E.g.:

```shell
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/index.html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 210

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"/>
    <title>Http Server</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>index.html</h1>
</body>
</html> 
```

For **advanced** version:

| path | files in local fs | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /, /index.html | /`{static dir}`/index.html | 200 | text/html |
| /404.html | /`{static dir}`/404.html | 404 | text/html |
| /501.html | /`{static dir}`/501.html | 501 | text/html |
| [/\*]/\*.html | /`{static dir}`[/\*]/\*.html | 200 | text/html |
| [/\*]/\*.js | /`{static dir}`[/\*]/\*.js | 200 | text/javascript |
| [/\*]/\*.css | /`{static dir}`[/\*]/\*.css | 200 | text/css |
| [/\*]/\*.json | /`{static dir}`[/\*]/\*.json | 200 | application/json |
| any other error paths | /`{static dir}`/404.html | 404 | text/html |

```
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/data.json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 101

[{"id":"1","name":"Foo"},{"id":"2","name":"Bar"},{"id":"3","name":"Foo Bar"},{"id":"4","name":"Foo"}]
```

> For standardized testing, output JSON data in one line without unnecessary spaces.

**2) access web services for getting data**

For **basic** version:

| path | get data | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /api/check | strings in `data.txt` | 200 | text/plain |
| any other error paths | /{static files}/404.html | 404 | text/html |

E.g.:

```shell
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/check
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 13

id=1&name=Foo
```

For **advanced** version:

| path | get data | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /api/list | all objects in `data.json` | 200 | application/json |
| /api/search?[id=`value1`&name=`value2`] | all objects that match <br /> `*.id == value1 && *.name == value2` <br /> in `/data/data.json` | 200 | application/json |
| /api/search?[id=`value1`&name=`value2`] | if no object matches, return all objects <br /> in `/data/not_found.json` | 404 |application/json |
| any other error paths | /{static files}/404.html | 404 | text/html |

> If you do not want to parse json file, you could store the data in memory instead of reading file every time.

E.g.:

```shell
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -G -d 'id=1&name=Foo' \
> -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/search
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 25

[{"id":"1","name":"Foo"}] 
```

> For standardized testing, output JSON data in one line without unnecessary spaces.

#### 3.7.2 Using POST method

**access web services for uploading data**

all data you need to upload are two key/value pairs: `id: {value1}` & `name: {value2}`.

> For standardized testing, output in the order of `id`, `name`.

Your server should check the data. In default case, the server should echo the data from the client. 

If the data format is error, e.g., `id=1&name`, `id=1` or `id=1&foo=a`, send content error message.

For **basic** version:

The client should send requests with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

After handling, send response:

| path | content | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /api/echo | echo the data received | 200 | application/x-www-form-urlencoded |
| /api/echo | if the data format is error, send strings <br /> in `/data/error.txt` |  404 | text/plain |
| any other error paths | /{static files}/404.html | 404 | text/html |

E.g.:

```shell
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -d 'id=1&name=Foo' \
> -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
> -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/echo
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

id=1&name=Foo
```

For **advanced** version:

The client should send requests with `Content-Type`:
  * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
  * `application/json`.

After handling, send response:

| path | content | status code | content type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /api/upload | echo the data received | 200 | application/json |
| /api/upload | if the data format is error, send strings <br /> in `/data/error.json` | 404 | application/json |
| any other error paths | /{static files}/404.html | 404 | text/html |

E.g.:

```shell
user@linux:~/http-server$ curl -i -d '{"id":"1","name":"Foo"}' \
> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
> -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/upload
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 23

{"id":"1","name":"Foo"}
```

> For standardized testing, output JSON data in one line without unnecessary spaces.

#### 3.7.3 Other method

The HTTP server will not handle HTTP requests except GET requests and POST requests.

If you send a HTTP request with `DELETE` (or `PUT`, `HEAD`, etc.)  to delete the specified resource, your server should send `/{static dir}/501.html`:

### 3.8 Implementation requirements

**Version**

* **Basic version**

    Complete all the tasks of **the basic version** described in section `3.1.1~3.1.7` except `3.1.3` & `3.1.4`. 

* **Advanced version**

    Complete all the tasks of **the advanced version** described in section `3.1.1~3.1.7` **including `3.1.3` & `3.1.4`**. 

**Do a performce test**

Please test your code first, and commit a test report along with your lab code into your group’s course github repo.

The test report should describe the performance result under various testing conditions. Specifically, in your test report, you should at least contain the following two things:

1. Test how many HTTP request your server can process per second, when running on various server machine environments. For example, change the number of server CPU cores, enable/disable hyper-threading, etc. 
   
2. Test how many HTTP request your server can process per second, by varying the number of concurrent clients that send request to your server simultaneously. Do change the client's workload. For example, test when a client use new TCP connection for a new request, or when a client reuses old TCP connection for new requests. Moreover, if you implement the advanced version, try to change the number of out-bounding requests on the same client's TCP connection. You can write a simple client that send HTTP Get by your own (can run multiple client programs on the same machine to emulate multiple clients), or use some existing HTTP client testing tools such as [ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/ab.html). 

**[NOTE]**: Be careful that clients may be the performance bottleneck. So you'd better use multiple machines when testing the performance. For example, you can run multiple client processes on three machines (of three group members), and run the server process on another machine (of the other group member). Moreover, the network can be the bottleneck too. You can estimate the performance limit according to the physical bandwidth of your network environment, and see if your implementation can reach the performance limit. 

# 4. Tester & judger

We  provide some tools for testing & judging. 

You can check the repos of them: [tester](https://github.com/LabCloudComputing/http-server-tester) & [judger - not finished yet](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GJ411x7h7).

Of course you can also use your own browser and other web tools like curl.

# 5. Lab submission

Please put all your code in folder `Lab2` and write a `Makefile` so that we **can compile your code in one single command** `make`. The compiled runnable executable binary should be named `http-server` and located in folder `Lab2`. Please carefully following above rules so that TAs can automatically test your code!!!

Please submit your lab program and performance test report following the guidance in the [Overall Lab Instructions](../README.md) (`../README.md`)

# 6. Grading standards

* You can get 28 points if you can: 
   * finish all the requirements of the basic version

* You can get 30 points (full score) if you can:
  * finish all the requirements of the advanced version

If you missed some parts, you will get part of the points depending how much you finished.
