## 1. Overview

Implement a simple distributed in-memory key-value database (KV store) by your own, using two-phase commit protocol or raft protocol to guarantee the consistency and robustness of your KV store.

### Goals

* Get to know the problems and difficulties in building a distributed system;
* Know how to use a simple protocol to maintain consistency between multiple distributed servers;
* Use some simple schemes to handle server failures.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 KV store

An in-memory key-value database (also called **key-value store**, or **KV store** in this document) is a database that keeps all its data in the main memory and uses a simple key-value data structure. 

Typically, a KV-store exposes the following methods for users to store/delete/read data to/from the databases:

- **set(key, value)**: stores the value "value" with the key "key" (some KV stores also call this command as "**put**").
- **del(key)**: deletes any record associated with the key "key".
- **value=get(key)**: retrieves and returns the value associated with the key "key".

In practice, in-memory KV store serves most user requests only with data stored in the main memory, meanwhile, it often backups its data in the hard disks thus to be durable. However, in this lab, you are not required to consider the data durability (i.e., you can only store the data in main memory).  

### 2.2 Distributed KV store

In large-scale cloud services, KV stores are often built in distributed manner, for the sake of **performance and robustness**.   

For example, a KV store may distribute its data in multiple server machines, and simultaneously use those servers to serve user requests. As such, user requests can be evenly balanced to multiple servers when the load is high, and the database can survive from the failure of some servers.

However, when the KV database is distributed, many problems arise. Among those problems, **consistency issue** may be most notorious and toughest one. For example, assume that a KV database uses two servers A and B to hold data and serve user requests. When user 1 put some key at server A, and then after a very short time user 2 and 3 each posts a get request of this key to server A and B, respectively, then how to make sure that user 2 and 3 both **get the same latest value of this key**? What is more challenging, failures can happen on servers and networks when users are posting requests.

Next, we will introduce a very simple but classic protocol to ensure consistency among distributed database servers.

### 2.3 Two-phase commit

Now we describe possibly the simplest (but it works!) consensus protocol called **two-phase commit**, or **2PC**. This protocol can ensure the data consistency when the database is located on multiple distributed servers, that is, **two or more machines agree to do something, or not do it, atomically**. Note that this is only a very short introduction. You are encouraged to search more materials if you have further questions (e.g., [this](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1at411y7iQ) is a good video about 2PC).

Frist, 2PC maintains a **commit log** on each machine, which keeps track of whether commit has happened. Log is used to guarantee that all machines either commit or donâ€™t. 

Second, there is **one global coordinator**. It receives transactions from clients (e.g., set/delete/get) and reply results to clients, and coordinates multiple database servers, to ensure either all servers commit the transaction or all abort it.

Based on above architecture, 2PC operates in two distinct phases: 

1) The first phase is **prepared phase**. The global coordinator requests that all database servers (called participants) will promise to commit or rollback the transaction (e.g., set or delete a key) . Participants record promise in log, then acknowledge. If anyone votes to abort, coordinator writes "Abort" in its log and tells everyone to abort; each records "Abort" in log. 

2) The second phase is **commit-or-abort phase**. After all participants respond that they are prepared, then the coordinator writes "Commit" to its log. Then the coordinator asks all participants to commit; All participants respond with ACK. After receive ACKs, the coordinator writes "Got Commit" to log.

<img src="src/two-phase-commit.png" alt="two phase commit" title="two phase commit" style="zoom:40%;" />

The detailed steps in 2PC are as follows:

***Prepared phase:*** 

1)&ensp;To commit the transaction, the coordinator starts by sending a **REQUEST-TO-PREPARE** message to each
participant.

2)&ensp;The coordinator waits for all participants to "vote" on the request.

3)&ensp;In response to receiving a **REQUEST-TO-PREPARE** message, each participant votes by sending a message back to the coordinator, as follows:

- It votes **PREPARED** if it is prepared to commit.
- It may vote **NO** for any reason, usually because it cannot prepare the transaction due to a local failure.
- It may delay voting indefinitely, for example, because the network drops the vote.

***Commit-Or-Abort phase:***

1)&ensp;If the coordinator receives **PREPARED** messages from all participants, it decides to commit. The transaction is now officially committed. Otherwise, it either received a **NO** message or gave up waiting for some participant, so it decides to abort.

2)&ensp;The coordinator sends its decision to all participants (i.e.,**COMMIT** or **ABORT**).

3)&ensp;Participants acknowledge receipt of the commit or abort by replying **DONE**.

4)&ensp;After receiving **DONE** from all participants, the coordinator can reply clients with the transaction result (either success or failed), and *forget* the transaction, meaning that it can deallocate any memory it was using to keep track of information about the transaction.

### 2.4 raft

2PC protocol may not be able to deal with clients' requests even when coordinator fails, thus some extend methods are necessary, such as [Raft algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

You can also find more details in [Section 4.2](#42-advanced-version20-points)

## 3. Your Lab Task

### 3.1 Task overview

<img src="src\KVStoreOverview.jpg" alt="KVStoreOverview" style="zoom:50%;" />

You need to implement a simple distributed KV store. Your KV store should run as a network service on remote machine(s), which can receive clients' operations on the database and return results to clients, through network messages. To cope with failures, your are required to implement your KV store services on multiple machines (which are connected with each other through network). Use 2PC protocol to maintain database consistency among multiple machines. 

To simplify the task, your KV store data is only stored in main memory. Also, the log in 2PC protocol is also only stored in main memory. 

Detailed lab requirements are discussed below.

### 3.2 KV store command formats

Your KV store servers are only required to support three database commands: `SET`, `GET` and `DEL` commands (case sensitive). These commands (including arguments) and the return results are encapsulated into network messages using dedicated message format. For simplicity, all the keys and values are stored as strings in your KV store. 

Further details are as follows:

#### 3.2.1 Network message format

In this lab, you should use a **simplified version** of RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) message format to pass KV store commands from clients to servers (called request message) and pass command results from server to clients (called response message) . Specifically:

##### 3.2.1.1 Client request message

Clients send commands to the server using RESP Arrays (more details see `section 3.2.2`). RESP Arrays consist of:

- A `*` character as the first byte, followed by the number of elements in the array as a decimal number, followed by CRLF.
- Arbitrary number of bulk strings (up to 512 MB in length).

The bulk string consist of:

- A `$` byte followed by the number of bytes composing the string (a prefixed length), terminated by CRLF.
- The actual string data.
- A final CRLF.

For example, the string `CS06142` is encoded as follows:

`$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`

The bulk string `$7\r\nCS06142\r\n` start with a `$` byte, and the following number 7 indicate that the length of string `CS06142` is 7. Then, the terminated CRLF, actual string data `CS06142` and the final CRLF are next, consecutively.

##### 3.2.1.2 Server response message

1)&ensp;Success message: 

Success messages are encoded in the following way: a plus '+' character, followed by a string that cannot contain a CR or LF character (no newlines are allowed), terminated by CRLF (that is "\r\n").

For example, the `SET` command reply with just "OK" on success (more details see `section 3.2.2`):

`+OK\r\n`

2)&ensp;Error message:

Like success messages, error messages consist of: a minus '-' character, followed by a string, terminated by CRLF.

For example, if an error occurs, just return (more details see `section 3.2.2`):

`-ERROR\r\n` 

3)&ensp;RESP Arrays message:

Your server should return an RESP Arrays message when the `GET` command executed successfully (more detail see `section 3.2.2`).

For example:

`*2\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n` 

4)&ensp;Integer message:

Some commands need to return an integer (e.g., `DEL` command, more details see `section 3.2.2`). An integer message is just a CRLF terminated string representing an integer, prefixed by a ":" byte.

An integer message example: 

`:1\r\n`

#### 3.2.2 Database commands

**NOTE: `key & value`**
Before introducing the specific instruction specification, we first carry out the convention of the string specification.
In the commands used in lab3, there may be two types of strings attached: **key** and **value**.

**key**: The string used as a database index, we stipulate that this string does not contain spaces `' '`.

**value**: The string used as a database content, we stipulate that this string may contain spaces `' '`.

##### 3.2.2.1 SET command

`SET key value`

The function of the `SET` command is to set **key** to hold the string **value**. If key already holds a value, it is overwritten. For example, if you want to set key `CS06142` to hold the string `Cloud Computing`, the command would be:

`SET CS06142 "Cloud Computing"`

According to the message format we have discussed in `section 3.2.1`, this command would be encoded as a RESP message format:

`*4\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n`

**Note:** The encoded message start with a `*` byte. The following number 4 indicate that there are 4 bulk strings in this message. These bulk strings are `$3\r\nSET\r\n`, `$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`, `$5\r\nCloud\r\n`, and `$9\r\nComputing\r\n`. 


If the `SET` operation succeeds, the server will return a success message; otherwise, return an error message.

For example, if the `SET` operation succeeds, the server just returns:

`+OK\r\n`

Otherwise, it returns:

`-ERROR\r\n`

##### 3.2.2.2 GET command

`GET key`

`GET` command can get the **value** of **key**. If the key does not exist the special value `nil` is returned.

For example, if you want to check the value of the key `CS06142`, construct the command like this:

`GET CS06142`

Like the `GET` command, this command should be encoded as a specific message format before sending to the server. 

`*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`

If the `GET` command was executed correctly, the value (encoded as RESP Arrays format) of the key will be returned. 

For example, if the command above executed correctly, return:

`*2\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n`

, assuming the value of the key `CS06142` is`Cloud Computing`.

If the key does no exist, just return:

`*1\r\n$3\r\nnil\r\n`

If an error occurs, return an error message:

`-ERROR\r\n`

##### 3.2.2.3 DEL command

`DEL key1 key2 ...`

The `DEL` command is used for removing one or more specified **keys** (arbitrary number, up to 512 MB message length). A key is ignored if it does not exist.

The `DEL` command should return the number of keys that were removed.

For example, if you want to delete key `CS06142` and key `CS162`, you can construct the `DEL` command:

`DEL CS06142 CS162`

Similar to the `SET` and `GET` commands, the `DEL` command will be encoded in RESP message as follows:

`*3\r\n$3\r\nDEL\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n$5\r\nCS162\r\n`

The server will return the number of keys that were removed.

For example, if the `DEL` command above executed, return an integer message:

`:1\r\n`

**note:** Because we only set the key `CS06142` to hold a value. As for key `CS162`, it will be ignored because it does no exist. So, the number in the integer message is 1.

If an error occurs, return an error message:

`-ERROR\r\n`

### 3.3 Use 2PC protocol to build a KV store on multiple servers

You should implement the coordinator and participant program. 

The **coordinator** does not store any data. It only receives and parses KV commands from clients, runs 2PC protocol to coordinates participants to conduct the KV commands consistently, and reply command results to clients. *There is only one coordinator in the whole system*.

Each **participant** maintains a KV database in its main memory, and conduct KV commands sent from the coordinator, and return results to the coordinator. 

You can use any message format for communication between the coordinator and participants. For example, you can also use the RESP format introduced before, or use some other RPC library.  

### 3.4 Use consensus protocol to build a KV store on multiple servers (e.g. Raft Algorithm)

You can implement multiple KV store servers, where each server can receive requests from clients, stores data, and reply responses. Clients are preconfigured with all servers' addresses, and may send KV commands to any of the server, randomly. To keep consistency, normally there is only one leader server that deal with all the clients' requests, and backup the data in other servers. Clients' commands to other servers are all redirected to the leader. The consensus protocol can help servers to detect the failure of the leader server, and reelect a new leader. Also, the consensus protocol can help to maintain database consistency among multiple servers.

### 3.5 Run your program

#### 3.5.1 Program arguments

Enable long options to accept arguments in your program, just like lab2. There should be one and only one argument for your program: `--config_path`, which specifies the path of the configuration file. All the detailed configurations are written in the configuration file. Your program should read and parse the configuration file, and run as coordinator or participant accordingly. 

***
**FOR BASIC VERSION:**

If your program is called **kvstore2pcsystem**:

run the **coordinator** process, just typing (`./src/coordinator.conf` is the coordinator's configuration file)

`./kvstore2pcsystem --config_path ./src/coordinator.conf`

run the **participant** process, just typing (`./src/participant.conf` is the participant's configuration file)

`./kvstore2pcsystem --config_path ./src/participant.conf`

When you run the command above, your program should run correctly without any further inputs.

***
**FOR ADVANCED VERSION:**

If your program is called **kvstoresystem**:

All server programs should use a uniform format configuration file.

Unlike the 2PC protocol, here we no longer pre-set a server as the center of the cluster.

Taking Raft as an example, the server cluster should elect the master itself after running.

run the **server001** process, just typing (`./src/server001.conf` is the coordinator's configuration file)

`./kvstoresystem --config_path ./src/server001.conf`

When you run the command above, your program should run correctly without any further inputs.

You can make persistent storage by reading and writing files, but for ease of testing, make sure that for each process, their persistent file paths **do not conflict under any circumstances**.

#### 3.5.2 Configuration file format

##### 3.5.2.1 **FOR BASIC VERSION:**

A configuration file consists of two kinds of lines: 1) parameter line, and 2) comment line.

- **A comment line** starts with a character '!'. The whole comment line are not parsed by the program.
- **A parameter line** starts with a *parameter*, followed by a *value*. The parameter and value are separated by a whitespace. Parameter lines specify the necessary information that the coordinator or participants should know before running. There are three valid parameters: `mode`, `coordinator_info`, and `participant_info`.
  - The parameter `mode` specifies that whether the program runs as a coordinator or a participant. Its value should only be either `coordinator` or `participant`. `mode` line is always *the first parameter line* in the configuration file.
  - The parameter `coordinator_info` specifies the network address that the coordinator is listening on. Its value consists of the IP address and port number (separated by character ':' ). Clients and participants can communicate with the coordinator using this network address.  Since there is only one coordinator, there is only one `coordinator_info` line in both coordinator's and participants' configuration file.
  - The parameter `participant_info` consists of the network address that participant process is listening on. Its value consists of the IP address and port number (separated by character ':' ). The coordinator can communicate with the participant using this network address. For participants, there is only one `participant_info` line in the configuration file, specifying its own network address; For the coordinator, there can be multiple `participant_info` lines in the configuration file, specifying the network addresses of all participants.


Sample coordinator configuration file:

```
!
! Coordinator configuration
!      2020/05/07 11:25:33
!
! The argument name and value are separated by whitespace in the configuration file.
!
! Mode of process, coordinator OR participant
mode coordinator
!
! The address and port the coordinator process is listening on.
! Note that the address and port are separated by character ':'. 
coordinator_info 127.0.0.1:8001
!
! Address and port information of all participants. 
! Three lines specifies three participants' addresses.
participant_info 127.0.0.1:8002 
participant_info 127.0.0.1:8003 
participant_info 127.0.0.1:8004
```

Sample participant configuration file:

```
!
! Participant configuration
!      2020/05/07 11:25:33
!
! The argument name and value are separated by whitespace in the configuration file.
!
! Mode of process, coordinator OR participant
mode participant
!
! The address and port the participant process is listening on.
participant_info 127.0.0.1:8002
!
! The address and port the coordinator process is listening on.
coordinator_info 127.0.0.1:8001
```


##### 3.5.2.2 **FOR ADVANCED VERSION:**

A configuration file consists of two kinds of lines: 1) parameter line, and 2) comment line.

- **A comment line** starts with a character '!'. The whole comment line are not parsed by the program.
- **A parameter line** starts with a *parameter*, followed by a *value*. The parameter and value are separated by a whitespace. Parameter lines specify the necessary information that the coordinator or participants should know before running. There are two valid parameters:  `self_info`, and `others_info`.
  - The parameter `self_info` specifies the network address that this server itself is listening on. Its value consists of the IP address and port number (separated by character ':' ). Clients and other servers can communicate with this server using this network address.
  - The parameter `other_info` consists of the network address that other servers' process is listening on. Its value consists of the IP address and port number (separated by character ':' ). The server itself can communicate with the others using this network address.


Sample server configuration file:

```
!
! Server configuration
!      2022/05/02 21:38:33
!
! The argument name and value are separated by whitespace in the configuration file.
!
! The address and port the server itself process is listening on.
! Note that the address and port are separated by character ':'. 
self_info 127.0.0.1:8001
!
! Address and port information of all other servers. 
! Three lines specifies three other servers' addresses.
other_info 127.0.0.1:8002 
other_info 127.0.0.1:8003 
other_info 127.0.0.1:8004
```


## 4 Implementation requirements

### 4.1 Basic version (18 points totally)

In order to finish the new Lab4, you should finish 2nd level of Basic version in Lab3 at least.

If you want to get excellent score in Lab4, please try to finish [Section 4.2](#42-advanced-version20-points).

#### 4.1.1 1st level of Basic version(15 points)

Your program should complete all the tasks described in `section 3.1-3.4`. Your system is required to correctly receive and conduct the KV commands, and reply the corresponding results, as described before. 

In the 1st level of basic version, there will be **no participant failures**. Also, we will **not inject any network failures**. However, the network may still drop packets occasionally. You can use TCP to handle such occasional drops. 

**The coordinator process may be killed and restart at any time for multiple times**. So do not store any database data in the coordinator. The coordinator will deal with clients' KV commands when it is working. When the coordinator is killed, your system is not required to reply any client's commands. Clients will keep retransmit its KV commands until it gets success response from the coordinator. The coordinator remembers no history (except for the information in the configuration file), so it will deal with all commands as new ones after it restarts.

Your program should run correctly with 3 or more participants.

#### 4.1.2 2nd level of Basic version(16 points)

Your program should complete all the tasks described in `section 3.1-3.4`. Your system is required to correctly receive and conduct the KV commands, and reply the corresponding results, as described before.  

In the 2nd level of Basic version, **participants may fail, and the network links may fail**. However, the participant and network link **failures are one-shot**, that is, if they fail, they will never come back again. Also, **the coordinator process may be killed and restart at any time for multiple times**. The coordinator will deal with clients' KV commands when it is working. When the coordinator is killed, your system is not required to reply any client's commands. 

When the coordinator is working, it should be able to detect the failure of participants. You can use some periodical heartbeat messages to detect the participant failure (e.g., no reply after certain number of heartbeats). **Once a participant is dead, the coordinator should be able to remove it from the system, and correctly receive/conduct/reply clients' KV commands with the rest participants**. If all participants fail, the coordinator will always reply ERROR to the clients' KV commands. The coordinator remembers no history (except for the information in the configuration file), so it need to redetect all the participants' liveness after restart.

Your program should run correctly with 3 or more participants.

**NOTE**: **Groups that have registered for demo 3 should at least finish the advanced version.** 

#### 4.1.3 3rd level of Basic version(18 points)

Your program should complete all the tasks described in `section 3.1-3.4`. Your system is required to correctly receive and conduct the KV commands, and reply the corresponding results, as described before.  

In the 3rd level of Basic version, **participants may fail, and the network links may fail**. The participant and network link **failures can be both permanent or transient**, that is, if they fail, they may come back again at any time. Also, **the coordinator process may be killed and restart at any time for multiple times**. The coordinator will deal with clients' KV commands when it is working. When the coordinator is killed, your system is not required to reply any client's commands. 

When the coordinator is working, it should be able to detect **both failure and recovery** of participants. Once a participant is dead, the coordinator should be able to remove it from the system; Once a participant is recovered, the coordinator should be able to add it back to the system. Note that to keep database consistent, after a participant recovers from failure, you should copy the latest KV store database from some working participants to this recovered participant. We will not provide any copy protocols for you. You are encouraged to devise your own schemes as long as it is correct. You should be very careful about the consistency issue since the failures can be very complex and random. For example, considering the case that there are two participants A and B, A fails first and then A comes back and B fails later. During this procedure, client's may keep sending KV commands, so A needs to sync those new KV commands after coming back, otherwise it cannot server client's request correctly after B fails. 

We will randomly inject failure and recovery to all the participants and network links. To ensure the database can be successfully copied, during our test, after a participant (or its network link) is recovered from failure, we will ensure that *no failures happen in the following 10 seconds* (no coordinator/participant/network failure). Your coordinator should be able to copy the latest database to the newly recovered participant in this 10 seconds. Moreover, we will always ensure that *there is at least one working participant* in the system. As such, the coordinator should be able to correctly receive/conduct/reply clients' KV commands during the failures and recoveries.

Your program should run correctly with 3 or more participants.

**NOTE**: **Groups that have registered for demo 4 should at least finish the 3rd level of Basic version** 

### **4.2 Advanced version(20 points)**

Since the coordinator may permanently fail, your system should also **be able to deal with clients' requests even when coordinator fails**. 2PC is not able to handle this problem. So in this version, you will not use 2PC protocol, but use some advanced consensus protocol to handle this case. 

You can implement multiple KV store servers, where each server can receive requests from clients, stores data, and reply responses. Clients are preconfigured with all servers' addresses, and may send KV commands to any of the server, randomly. To keep consistency, normally there is only one leader server that deal with all the clients' requests, and backup the data in other servers. Clients' commands to other servers are all redirected to the leader. The consensus protocol can help servers to detect the failure of the leader server, and reelect a new leader. Also, the consensus protocol can help to maintain database consistency among multiple servers.

[Raft](https://raft.github.io/) is a very good consensus protocol for this purpose. You may want to read its paper by yourself and use raft to implement this version (there are many open-sourced raft implementation that you can borrow). Sorry I'm not going to teach you this : ) Of course, it is always good to use other consensus protocols or even your own schemes.

**Tips for testing**:
**When doing Advanced version, you should give [server-style](#3522-for-advanced-version) configuration files to all servers.** 


**P.S.**
**If you want to finish Lab4 excellently, `Raft` is a better choice than `2PC`.**

**NOTE**: **This version is very difficult, so it is not compulsory but just a challenge. Have fun!**
